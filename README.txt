How To Run:
1. first run a npm install (should install all dependencies)
2. Then run the database initializer node .\database-initializer.js
3. After creating the required packages and dropping any similar to this
4. run the server node .\movie-server.js
5. after running the server go to your preferred browser maybe microsoft edge cuz I only tested it there for now
6. and type in browser localhost:3000/ since this only listens on the 3000 port 
7. and then for further details on my prject pls go to the REPORT folder in this folder and pick either a Doc or
